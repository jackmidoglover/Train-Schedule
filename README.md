# Train-Scheduler

## What it Does
The Train Scheduler displays the schedule for current trains and allows users to add new trains with different names, destinations, and frequencies.
It saves the user input as an object in an associated firebase.
The app then uses moment.js to calculate the next arrival time and minutes until arrival to create a dynamic train schedule.
